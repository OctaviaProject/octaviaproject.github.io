    <p><b>This spring, we are making a long time dream a reality: free monthly Saturday workshops throughout 
        the year.</b></p> 
        
        <p>Not only will Saturday workshops help us to support our summer participants throughout 
        the year, we will be able to serve more girls. <b>These workshops will expand the reach of the Octavia 
        Project at a time when programming that empowers young women of color is needed the most.</b></p>
        
    <p>While funding for our 2017 summer camp has been provided through <a href="http://octaviaproject.org/2016/12/06/VanderMeer-Creative-sponsors-our-Summer-2017-program.html"> 
        sponsorship from VanderMeer Creative</a>, we still need the support of our dedicated community 
        members to provide Saturday workshops monthly this spring.</p>
