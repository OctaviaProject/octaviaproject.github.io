This was the end, all of his efforts leading to this one single moment. He had a single choice to make: control the reapers, destory them, or bid to their wishes and mix biotic DNA with theirs. 
He knew what he had to do. 
[[choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="choice" tags="" position="740,518">The Commander sent a quick prayer to any God that was out there. This one moment would define the future of the Galaxy for all of time. If he made the wrong choice, every race would be doomed. His friends, his fellow soliders, they would have all banded together for nothing.
He begins to walk toward the red light, destroy. He would destory the Reapers, at the cost of their knowledge and power. The risk to control them was too great. 
He raises his gun to shoot, once, twice, the panel expolding in red flames. He feels the flames burning his skin. Accepting his fate, he closes his eyes and then...
He wakes up in his bed on the Normandy. </tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
