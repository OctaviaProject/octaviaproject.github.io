We embodied urban planning with guest teacher Daphne Lundi, planning for climate risks in NYC hundreds and thousands of years in the future.

Then we created emergent maps of future imaginary cities.

The rest of week two was filled with Curanderismo and healing, book club, branching narratives, and collaborative story-building.
