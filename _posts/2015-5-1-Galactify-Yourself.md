Have you ever wondered who you might be in another world? ...Another galaxy? What would you be called? 
What form would you take? Where would you call home? 

Maybe you're Ovtavoa Yzojict, the wise architect from pleasure planet Ripinij. Or Odjea Gorgu Kzinyo Hreaves, the metallic fortune teller from the Devovivu empire. Or maybe you're Twur, the bioluminescent spy from the ice moon of Kerijuz.

Or perhaps you're someone else entirely?  We invite you to [find out](http://octaviaproject.org/galactify/). Mechak Eilrea and Ctaki Yorher can't wait to meet you...
