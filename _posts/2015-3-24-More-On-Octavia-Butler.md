Here at the Octavia Project we were just discussing Imran Siddiquee's article from *The Atlantic* which focuses 
on the way in which [many popular teen dystopian novels](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/the-topics-dystopian-films-wont-touch/382509/?single_page=true) deal with oppression, totalitarianism, and scarcity while 
racism has magically disappeared. 

The author's conclusion? Make movie franchises from Octavia Butler's work! 

>"Butler simultaneously confronts a myriad of oppressions and portrays her black protagonist’s success as not only 
> the result of determination, intelligence and bravery—but also her 'hyperempathy' for others and an intense belief 
> in the concept of 'change.' As Lauren says in [Butler's *Parable of the Sower*]:
> >"Embrace diversity. Unite—or be divided, robbed, ruled, killed by those who see you as prey. Embrace diversity, 
or be destroyed."

Embrace diversity of people and their experiences, Hollywood. No more white-washing our futures. Or be destroyed... 
(*maniacal laugh*)
