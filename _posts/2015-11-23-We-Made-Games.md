As part of our summer program girls wrote, designed and programmed online text-based games.  

There is a game that works like a [mad-lib](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/isheyana/madlib.html), and another one that features a [fortune cookie](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/osas/yourdestiny.html). There are games about [friends with super powers](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/naya/nayastory.html), [creepy neighbors](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/samori/TheLakehouse.html), and [fairy tale remixes](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/diondi/goldylocks.html). Give them a try--you'll get a different outcome each time you play!

You can see the rest of the projects we made--block prints, sculptures, 3D models, wearable electronics and more--in our [digital portfolios](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/).
