    <div class="about">
      <p>The Octavia Project uses girls’ passion in science-fiction, fantasy, fan-fiction, gaming, and art to 
      teach skills in science, technology, art, and writing, while enabling girls to dream new futures for themselves 
      and their communities.</p>

      <p>10-15 girls, ages 13-18, will participate in this free summer program, engineering models of their own fictional 
      cities, bringing pages of their story to life with paper circuits, and programing games built on narratives they authored. 
      They will have access to women working in science and tech, internship and online publishing opportunities, and 
      college-aged mentors.</p>

      <p>Our inspiration and namesake is ground-breaking author Octavia E. Butler and her 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://octaviabutler.org"> visions of possible futures</a>.</p>

      <br>
      
      <h1>Impact</h1>

      <p>We know that a majority of students who enter high school excited about science, technology, engineering and 
      math (STEM), 
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stemconnector.org/sites/default/files/store/STEM-Students-STEM-Jobs-Executive-Summary.pdf"> 
          leave school uninterested in these subjects</a>. 
      We also know, due to unequal access and biased norms, 
      girls and students from low-income homes are significantly less likely to be engaged in 
      STEM as they grow older.</p>

      <p>The Octavia Project aims to serve girls from low-income neighborhoods and under-served 
      schools in this precarious time, before the internal narrative of “I’m not a math person” or 
      “Science just isn’t my thing” takes over.</p>

      <p>The Octavia Project will offer dynamic programming that connects skill-building in science and tech with 
      girls’ personal interests and hobbies, forging a safe space for teenage girls to learn through joy and creation. 
      Octavia Project participants will gain allies, resources, and a relationship to life-long learning. </p>

      <p>Workshops--lead by teaching artists and professionals specializing in science, tech, art and writing--will 
      build 21st century skills: art and writing workshops will focus on creativity, innovation, communication and 
      critical thinking, while science and tech workshops will focus on programming, engineering and digital and 
      media literacy.</p>

      <br>
