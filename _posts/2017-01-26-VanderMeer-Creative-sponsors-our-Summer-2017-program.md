There is a game that works like a [mad-lib](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/isheyana/madlib.html), 



We have some exciting news to share: Our summer 2017 program has been fully sponsored by 
[VanderMeer Creative](http://vandermeercreative.com/), a project of editor Ann VanderMeer 
and author Jeff VanderMeer.  

With our 2017 program funded, plans are already underway to enroll more participants, update and 
improve our curriculum, and grow our cohort of teachers and guest teachers. We know that empowering 
young women is more important today than ever.

With this extremely generous gift, we are taking the opportunity to start recruitment earlier, further 
develop workshops that continue to respond to the needs of our participants, and come up with more 
exciting projects that blend learning in science, tech, art, and writing.

In these uncertain times, we find comfort in knowing that Ann and Jeff's generosity has enabled 
us to get a valuable jump on planning for this summer and future summers. Join the support. 
Help the Octavia Project make a [lasting impact](http://octaviaproject.org/support.html) 
not only this summer, but for summers to come.

Along with sponsorship of our 2017 summer program, VanderMeer Creative is offering an 
all-expenses-paid scholarship, including air travel, for one 2017 Octavia Project participant 
to attend the summer writing intensive Shared Worlds, at Wofford College in South Carolina, 
in 2018.

Read more about the VanderMeer Creative sponsorship and Shared Worlds scholarship in our 
press release. We are thrilled to have the support of such an incredible organization.

Octavia Project is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non‐profit arts service 
organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Octavia Project must be made 
payable to “Fractured Atlas” and are tax‐deductible to the extent permitted by law.
