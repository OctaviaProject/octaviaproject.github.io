        <p>The Octavia Project offers unique programming that builds confidence and community—but our 
            participants put it best:</p>

<h2>"I’ve definitely become more of a leader this summer.”<br>
             – Octavia Project Fellow</h2>
        
<h2>“I like being a female nerd in the world. I like the fact that the <br>
    Octavia Project is a group for all different and unique types of people.” <br>
    – Aleiyah, 16</h2><br>

    <p>This summer, we’ll be growing our program to accept 20 students.</p>

<p>Help us raise $11,000 by March 28 so that more teens like Aleiyah and Nia can benefit from our 
    immersive Summer Institute.</p>
