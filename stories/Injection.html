It had been three weeks since I last saw her. It was hard to hold back the tears as they welled up in my eyes. The only person I had left was gone. I could&#x27;nt bear to stay here any longer. I was supposed to go to the doctor but I had other things on my mind that were bigger then some stupid vaccine.

The picure frames layed dormant on the table in front of me. The air was still and mother&#x27;s slippers were still at the foot of the couch. He sighed as he sat on the couch that smelt of his father&#x27;s cologne. The television was on but all he could hear was static.

He finally reaches his brother&#x27;s room and rummages through the drawer. The gun lies in his hand and with a fluid motion he points it to his temple. Through the corner of his eye he sees his brother&#x27;s mirror. His reflection is one of a broken man. His eyes are red and tired. The beard on his face rugged and unkept. His hair nappy and twisted. The gun is now loaded and his finger is on the trigger. 

[[He ends his life with a quick bullet to the head]]

[[He drops the gun in shame knowing he can&#x27;t willingly end his own life]]

His hatred for himself was almost seeping out of his skin. He walked to his room and laid in his bed, as he realized he had work tomorrow. He woke up to his boss calling his phone. He was late...again. His boss was furious, she said she understood his situation but he could not keep arriving to the job late.

How they were all sorry for his loss and how he could confide in them. They were all fake. The only conversation he had shared with most of these people was a simple hello. Why had it taken the death of everyone he held dear for him to be fully recognized. He was angry and did not want their fake words and apologies.

He stood motionless and as he was about to open his mouth she cut him off. &quot;Listen, due to your circumstances if you manage to make it early three days in a row I might be able to promote you&quot;. He would probably be happy about that if the face of his dead loved ones werent seared into his memory. &quot;And my records tell me you haven&#x27;t gotten your vaccine yet, you should get on that.&quot; He nodded and walked to the elevator. What good had it done for his mother or his father, and even his brother? He had lost his hope and his faith.
