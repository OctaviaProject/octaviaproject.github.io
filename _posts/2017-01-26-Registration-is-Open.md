This spring, the Octavia Project is partnering with the makerspace Geek Forest to offer

Alien World**, a three-hour workshop that combines creative writing, science fiction, botany, 
and painting. 

Past participants, come out and say hi to your OP friends!  If you’re new to the Octavia 
Project, this is a great way to see what we’re all about!  Or, **if you know a teen girl* who 
might be interested in our summer program, have her check out a workshop!**

**When:** Workshop 1- Saturday, Feb. 25, 12-3pm<br>
**Where:** Geek Forest, Williamsburg, Brooklyn<br>
**How:** Registration is mandatory as seating is limited! [Register here.](http://www.thegeekforest.com/products/saturday-february-25th-12-3pm-octavia-project-field-guide-to-an-alien-world?variant=34409189967) 
Registration for this workshop is free and open to teen girls* ages 13-17.  (*We welcome 
participants who are trans, gender non-conforming, and questioning.)  Healthy snacks will 
be provided. [Find a sharable flyer here.](octaviaproject.github.io/assets/OP_Saturday_Workshop_1_Flyer.pdf)

**Workshop 1: Field Guide To An Alien World**
Join the Octavia Project for a special workshop about alien plant life, creative writing, painting, 
and science fiction! This workshop will use art, botany, and imagination to design a plant that might 
be found in an alien world. Participants will paint an alien plant that will be included in an alien 
world field guide. Participants will each receive a digital copy of this publication and will leave the 
workshop with an idea for a science fiction story, an introduction to plant science, and a taste of the 
Octavia Project summer program.

And save the date for **Workshop 2, Saturday, April 1**.  Come to one, come to two, come to both--up to you!

*These workshops are made possible through the support of our community. We couldn’t provide these educational 
opportunities without you. Thank you so much!*
