Our Portfolio Showcase at the beautiful Seven Stories Press was such a smash! 

We sculpted with electrifying circuitry, crafted fantastical flowers, and played our participants' online adventure games. 
Thanks so much for celebrating our girls' wonderful projects and listening to them speak about why the Octavia Project is 
important, all while becoming a part of [our growing community](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.811142809011869.1073741838.681890758603742&type=3&pnref=story). 

Did you miss the party? You can still [play the games](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/games) the girls designed last 
summer and [explore their portfolios](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/). While you're there, check out co-founder 
Chana's [Origins of the Octavia Project](http://octaviaproject.org/portfolios/Origins.html) game--an interactive way to 
learn how the Octavia Project began. 

Finally, we're gearing up for summer 2016--here's how you can help:<br>
* Know any teenage girls who might be interested in participating in our free summer program? [Send them our way!](http://octaviaproject.org/join.html) <br>
