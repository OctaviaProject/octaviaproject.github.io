    <div class="about">
      <p>The Octavia Project uses the creative power of science fiction to imagine new futures and greater possibilities for our 
          world. We create spaces of imagination for Brooklyn teens, blending  creative writing, art, science, and technology to 
          create rich, interdisciplinary workshops that encourage critical thinking, build confidence, and develop skills in a myriad 
          of subjects.</p>

      <p>At our Summer Institute, young women and trans, gender non-conforming, or questioning youth from all over Brooklyn come 
          together to muse on alternate histories and possible futures with award-winning authors; stretch their minds by coding 
          interactive games based on their own stories; and attend interactive lectures in city planning and cellular biology. 
          Guest teachers and artists knit their expertise into our world building science fiction curriculum: These architects, 
          biologists, computer programmers, city planners, authors, and artists help create a totally unique program which allows 
          for deep exposure to multiple disciplines and possible career paths. Through these interdisciplinary workshops, participants 
          are able to inhabit their own science fiction and fantasy worlds. And they do this while creating community that is rooted 
          in joy, compassion, encouragement, and self love.</p> 
        
      <p>Our new Fellowship Program gives returning participants, age 16 and up, the opportunity to take on leadership and mentoring 
          roles within the community, in addition to gaining all the benefits of participating in our Summer Institute. Fellows lead 
          exercises, advise program leaders, and mentor new participants; additionally, they receive stipends in acknowledgement of 
          their additional responsibilities.</p>
          
        <p>We use the lens of science fiction and fantasy to examine our current world and see the social and legal contracts that 
            shape our city, schools, streets, and neighborhoods. Our teens gain the understanding that the world around them was 
            created by a series of choices, and those choices can be modified, remade, or replaced by something new. Our inspiration 
            and namesake is Octavia E. Butler, who <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/books/science-fiction.html"> 
            broke barriers in writing and science fiction</a> to become an award-winning and internationally recognized author 
            (<i>Kindred, Lilith's Brood</i>). We are inspired by her visions of alternate futures and commitment to social justice.</p>

        <h3>One-day workshops for teens</h3>
        <p>Our one-day workshops for teens take one module from our summer program--for example, urban planning, 
            architecture, wearable electronics, or computer programming--and bring it to your school, 
            Girl Scout troop, community center, or out-of-school program. <a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@octaviaproject.org">

        <h3>Workshops for adults</h3>
            <p>"I wish I could do The Octavia Project!" We hear this from adults all the time, so we've 
                adapted modules from our curriculum to suit an adult audience. We will bring our interdisciplinary,
                interactive workshops to your office, friend-group, or local watering hole. <a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@octaviaproject.org">

        <h3>Professional development for educators</h3>
        <p>Last summer, Octavia Project head teachers lead a professional development session for K-12 public 
            school teachers, hosted by The Brooklyn Public Library, on teaching programming through creative writing.
            Participants learned introductory programming concepts, designed their own narrative online game, and 
            thought about how game design based around creative writing can be adapted for the ELA, Social Studies, 
            and math classroom. <a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@octaviaproject.org">
