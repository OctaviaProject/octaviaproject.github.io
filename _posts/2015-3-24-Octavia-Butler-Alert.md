A new science fiction anthology entitled *Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social 
Justice Movements* will come out this spring from AK press. 

Walidah Imarisha, *Octavia's Brood* co-editor, describes their mission.

>"We started the anthology with the belief that all organizing is science fiction. When we talk about 
a world without prisons; a world without police violence; a world where everyone has food, clothing, 
shelter, quality education; a world free of white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, heterosexism; we 
are talking about a world that doesn’t currently exist. But collectively dreaming up one that does 
means we can begin building it into existence."

This beautiful article asserts science fiction as an active tool of social justice.
