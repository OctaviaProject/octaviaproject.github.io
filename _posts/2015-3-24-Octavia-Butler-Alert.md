A new science fiction anthology entitled *Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social 
Justice Movements* will come out this spring from AK Press. (See below for an important update about 
[AK Press](http://www.akpress.org/).)

Walidah Imarisha, *Octavia's Brood* co-editor, describes their mission.

>"We started the anthology with the belief that all organizing is science fiction. When we talk about 
a world without prisons; a world without police violence; a world where everyone has food, clothing, 
shelter, quality education; a world free of white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, heterosexism; we 
are talking about a world that doesnâ€™t currently exist. But collectively dreaming up one that does 
means we can begin building it into existence."

This beautiful article asserts science fiction as an active tool of social justice.
