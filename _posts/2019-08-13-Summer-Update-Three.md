<em>Our fifth and final week began with a day of activities organized by the Octavia Project Fellows.</em> They kept us busy with Rememberlution jars, games, lanyards, and LOTS of karaoke!

We spent the next few days working hard to craft our digital portfolios using WordPress.

To close out the summer, we invited our friends and families to join us for our annual Portfolio Showcase.

At the Showcase, friends and family were able to look through our [digital portfolios](http://portfolios.octaviaproject.org/), play our [Twine games](/2019/07/20/Our-Twines.html), and learn more about all the projects we did this summer.

The event closed with several participants reading their own writing and a ceremony honoring all 20 of our participants and Fellows.

Thank you to our community, our BFFs, all of our supporters, and our incredibly hard working Advisory Board for making another phenomenal summer possible!
