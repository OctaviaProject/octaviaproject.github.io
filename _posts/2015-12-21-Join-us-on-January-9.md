This summer, nine girls from Brooklyn brought their imaginary worlds to life. As part of our inaugural month-long workshop, 
they wrote, sculpted, 3D modeled, designed online games, crafted wearable electronics, and more.

**Join us to celebrate their achievements**—you’ll hear from the girls who participated, view their project portfolios, 
and even get a chance to play the games they designed.

**Saturday, January 9, 2016**<br>
Come by anytime from 4-7pm<br>
Seven Stories Press<br>
140 Watts St, NY, NY<br>
[RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/470829389787706/)

Friends and family welcome! Invite a teenage girl who might want to join the Octavia Project or an educator, techie, 
writer, or community member you think will love what we’re doing!
