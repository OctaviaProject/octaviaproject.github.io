        <p><h3>The Octavia Project Summer Institute</h3> is a FREE month-long program
         where young women and trans, nonbinary, or gender non-conforming youth 
        from Brooklyn explore their love of science fiction and fantasy through art, writing, 
            science, and tech projects with a community of creatively-minded peers.</p>
      
      <p>Our Summer Institute runs from July 2 - August 2. We meet four days a week--Tuesdays, 
          Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays--from 1pm-4:30pm. Workshops are held at the 
          <b>Pratt Institute MFA in Writing Community Space</b>, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn.</p>
      
      <p><b><i>We encourage youth living in the nearby neighborhoods of Bed Stuy, Bushwick, 
          Fort Greene, and Crown Heights to apply.</i></b> We provide MetroCards to 
      participants to cover travel to and from all workshops.</p>
