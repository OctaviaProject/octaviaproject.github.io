If you're in NYC (and over 21) join us on Wed., April 29, for our Launch Party!

Buy some raffle tickets, win some prizes, drink some beers, all while spreading the word about the 
Octavia Project and helping us meet our fundraising goal. We'll be hanging out at an awesome beer garden in 
Fort Greene, screening our favorite classic sci-fi movies, and playing intergalactic games!

So far, raffle prizes include a 4-book pack of feminist comics, a bundle of radical science-theory books from 
[Verso](http://www.versobooks.com/), 5 free yoga classes from [Brooklyn Yoga Collective](http://brooklynyogacollective.com/), 
and a bundle from [Criterion Collection](http://www.criterion.com/).

If you can't make it on April 29th, don't fret--you can still 
[add your support](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-octavia-project/x/10156321#home)!
