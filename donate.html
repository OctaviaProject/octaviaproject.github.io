      <h3>
          In order to keep this program 100% free for participants, we need to raise $12,000 by May 1.
      </h3>
      <p>
          If books have made you excited for the future, 
          <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-octavia-project/x/10156321"> 
          please consider donating to the Octaiva Project!</a> Your generous donation will cover costs such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Workshop space for one month</li>
        <li>Payment for teaching artists and stipends for guest speakers</li>
        <li>Production of a gallery showcase at the end of the summer</li>
        <li>Healthy snacks for the girls (brain food!)</li>
        <li>Computer software (InDesign, Photoshop, a Steam account loaded full of games)</li>
        <li>Art and tech materials (soldering irons, paint, LEDs, foam board, batteries)</li>
        <li>Liability insurance (boring but necessary!)</li>
    </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          Each $1,000 we raise will underwrite one girl to participate in the Octavia Project for one month.   
      </p>
      <p>
          If you help us surpass our original $12,000 goal and hit our FIRST STRETCH GOAL of $16,000, we’ll expand 
          to have SIXTEEN workshops in our summer series–30% more workshop time for each girl!
      </p>
      <p>
            And, if we can meet our SECOND STRETCH GOAL of $30,000, we’ll be able to commit to a first AND second year 
      of the Octavia Project, as you’ll help pay for things like a professional grant writer to secure funding for 
      2016!!!
